## Lab 1.1 MathFunHouse ##

**Part 0: Set-up**
- Create a Scanner object that reads in from the keyboard, and name it “key” (HINT: You only need ONE Scanner object for the whole lab.)
- Ask the user to enter their name and then print out a welcome message with their name.

**Part 1: Slope of a line**
- Ask the user to enter x1, x2, y1, y2
- Calculate the slope of the given line by subtracting the y values and dividing by the difference of the x values, then print the result.

**Part 2: Perimeter of a Rectangle**
- Generate two random numbers (one from 1 -10 inclusive, and one from 5 – 20 inclusive) to represent the length and width of a rectangle.
- Multiply each measurement by 2 and add together then print the result.

**Part 3: Area of a Trapezoid**
- Ask the user to enter the first base, the second base, and the height
- Add the bases together, then multiply by the height. Divide by 2 and print the result.

**Part 4: Volume of a Cone**
- Ask the user to enter the radius and the height.
- Use the formula: pi*r^2*(h/3) to calculate the volume and print the result. Note: Must use pow() method.
- Use Math.PI for pi

**Part 5: Surface area of a Cube**
- Ask the user to enter the height of the cube.
- Calculate the surface area by multiplying the squared height by 6 then print the result. Note: Must use pow() method.

**BONUS (+5): Hypotenuse**
- Ask the user to enter side A and B of a triangle.
- Calculate the hypotenuse and print the result. Note: Must use pow() method.
